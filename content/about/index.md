Hello! Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Amity University](https://www.amity.edu/) where I completed my Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering (2007-2011). 

I have done Masters in Software sytems () from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/)

I'm currently working as Assostant Manager  for **EY India** .

I'm also an [Innovation Agent](https://drive.google.com/file/d/117KS9QnDrcg7dllcAzGz_b7qQPgR3pGs/view?usp=sharing) fostering the culture of creativity and innovation at Amdocs, India.
